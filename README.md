# Temperature Conversion Program

This is a simple Python program that allows the user to convert temperatures between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. You will be prompted to select the unit of the temperature you want to convert from. You can choose from Kelvin (K), Celsius (C), or Fahrenheit (F).
3. Enter the temperature value.
4. The program will display the converted temperatures in the other two units.
5. You will be asked if you want to continue. Press 'y' to continue or any other key to exit.

## Functions

- `tem_in_kelvin(k)`: Converts a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- `tem_in_farenheit(f)`: Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
- `tem_in_celsius(c)`: Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
- `con()`: Asks the user if they want to continue.
- `choice()`: Prompts the user to enter the unit of the temperature they want to convert from.

## Note

This program uses the standard conversion formulas between the temperature units. The converted temperatures are rounded to two decimal places for simplicity.
